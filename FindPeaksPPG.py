# This is a function that finds the peaks and troughs of a pulsatile, periodic data set:  
#      Assumed use cases:  
#                           * By finding the peaks, we may be able to say something about 
#                                the level noise in the system.  
#                           * Finding the peaks in tandem with the peaks tells you the amplitude  
#                                 which is useful for mapping the intensity relative to the location  
#                                 of the PPG on the graph.
